# Traffic Accident Prediction using Abu Dhabi Dataset 2023

## Overview
This project aims to utilize the 'Traffic Accident Reports in Abu Dhabi Dataset 2023' to predict traffic accidents and identify potential hotspots. The goal is to assist urban planners, public safety officials, and other stakeholders in making data-driven decisions to improve road safety.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for running the example in an interactive environment)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/traffic-accident-prediction.git
   cd traffic-accident-prediction
   
2. Install the required packages:
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. Download the dataset:
   Access the dataset from [Traffic Accident-v3.0 (values) Abu Dhabi 2023.xlsx](https://data.abudhabi/transportation/traffic-accidents-2023) and place it in the data directory.

4. Run the example code:
   Execute the provided Python script or open it in a Jupyter Notebook to see the predictive model in action.

## Usage
The example script demonstrates how to load the dataset, preprocess the data, and use a Random Forest Classifier to predict the likelihood of accidents resulting in injuries. Adjust the model parameters and preprocessing steps as needed for your specific analysis.
